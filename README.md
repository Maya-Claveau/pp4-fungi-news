## **Why This**

<p>NFT is fairly new technology, the very first NFT was created back in 2014, then minted on the blockchain, it was sold for $4. Fast forward 8 years later today, NFT art is sold at millions of dollars, there are more and more people showing interest in this new technology. Big tech companies are building virtual universes even, who knows what else can be built with this.</p>

<p>I decided to build this project, because I personally believe this is our future, and I would like more people to be aware of this, get interested and try to understand it. For those who have the same interests as me, I hope this site can be a place to share and exchange information, knowledge and opinions about NFT and blockchain in general, so we get to know it better together.</p>
